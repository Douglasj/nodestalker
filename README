A Beanstalk client utilising node.js.
Depends on the yaml package from the kiwi package manager.


USAGE
=====

Simple usage example:

var sys = require('sys');
var bs = require('../lib/beanstalk_client');
var client = bs.Client();

client.use('default').onSuccess(function(data) {
  sys.puts(sys.inspect(data));

  client.put('my job').onSuccess(function(data) {
    sys.puts(sys.inspect(data));
    client.disconnect();
  });
});


BEANSPECTOR
===========

Also included is the cli demo app 'beanspector', that just outputs
info about tubes and gives one the possibility to empty and put jobs into them.
A simple

node beanspector.js -h

will give you the help output.


TESTING
=======

Also there are some tests now.
Please make sure beanstalkd is running on the default settings.

To run all tests:

find tests/ | grep .js | xargs -n1 node
